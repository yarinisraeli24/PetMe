description = `This impressive paella is a perfect party dish and a fun meal to cook
together with your guests. Add 1 cup of frozen peas along with the mussels,
if you like.`,
moreInfo = `Add rice and stir very gently to distribute. Top with artichokes and
peppers, and cook without stirring, until most of the liquid is absorbed,
15 to 18 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, add reserved shrimp and
mussels, tucking them down into the rice, and cook again without
stirring, until mussels have opened and rice is just tender, 5 to 7
minutes more. (Discard any mussels that donâ€™t open.)`
